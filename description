!post moderating ***DBM Muting System***
Muting system with 3 errors, DMs user that he's muted, sends a message to the"logs" channel if there is one, and includes timestamps, who authorized the command, and more.
This muting system uses roles in order to fully mute the member and mutes them from voice chat as well.

The system on first use creates a "Muted" role and sets the permissions to not be able to Send Messages, but they can still Read Messages!

**Error Messages:**
1. Invalid Permissions (says requires Mute Members permission).
2. Invalid Mention (says to mention a user to mute/unmute them).
3. Invalid Reasoning (says to add a reason of why you're banning them).

**Steps the System takes to execute the Mute:**
1. Checks for the errors listen above.
2. Adds the "Muted" role to the user.
3. Sends an embedded Muted Successfully message.
4. DMs the Muted user what server he has been muted from, who muted him, and the reasoning for the mute.
